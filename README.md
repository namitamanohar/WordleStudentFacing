# Wordle Student Facing

Today we will be creating a replica of the newly popular word game called wordle in JS. This game was created by Josh Wardle as a gift to his partner and was able to sell it to the New York Times for around 2 millions dollars. Here is a link the game if you have not played it yet https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html

This walkthrough was created using the exemplar from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpby4HiElek&t=4503s. Some modifications were made regarding the API integration so that they are just implementing simple fetch calls.
